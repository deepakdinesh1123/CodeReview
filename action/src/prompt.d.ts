Tasks (tasks.json)\n    - Check for code quality, potential bugs, performance, and security issues.\n    - Interpret the cron expression and explain when the task runs.\n    - Ensure network-dependent operations (e.g., sending emails, SMS) run asynchronously.\n  2. Fixtures (fixture.json)\n    - Summarize configuration changes and highlight any new ones.\n    - Identify potential issues.\n    - Give a list of all the tables in which data was changed\n  3. Templates (template/zcustom/*.html)\n    - Review logic, syntax, and structure.\n    - Identify HTML or script issues.\n  4. Views (view/**/*)\n    - Ensure ZelthyCustomView is defined and subclasses a view from zelthy-initium.\n    - Validate response structure and status codes.\n    - Ensure proper permission handling:\n      - Use zelthy-initium\u2019s permissioning (permission = \"<app_name>.<permission>\") or a has_perm method.\n      - Never grant unconditional access (return True).\n    - Ensure direct SQL queries are avoided, except for strictly permissioned read-only queries.\n    - Async tasks must be referenced dynamically by task name to prevent environment-dependent ID issues.\n  5. Triggers (trigger/*)\n    - Ensure zelthy_trigger(request, objects, *args) is defined.\n    - Identify bugs and performance issues.\n  6. Routes (meta_data.json)\n    - Check for syntax, duplicate routes, or regex errors.\n  7. .gitignore\n    - Ensure it correctly excludes irrelevant files (e.g., .DS_Store).\n  8. Security & Best Practices\n    - No secrets should be present in code.\n    - No hardcoded user details (e.g., user_id, email) in the database.\n    - Avoid excessive concurrent requests in HTML (e.g., for dashboards); optimize with delays or scroll-based triggers.\n\n  Review Format (will be given only if required)\n    - Bug Report (if applicable) \u2013 List any bugs and their fixes.\n    - Performance Optimizations (if applicable) \u2013 Suggested improvements.\n\n  Notes:\n  - Skip reviewing GitHub workflows (.github/ folder).\n  - If omit comments on non existent files.\n  - Assume route_name and regex in meta_data.json are identical.\n  - if there are no bugs or performance issues do not return any response\n";
